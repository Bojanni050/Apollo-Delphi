"""Local model runtime management for semantic indexing.

The application does not load embedding models itself -- it talks to an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (see core/embeddings.py). This module manages
where those weights come from.

Why a runtime at all, rather than embedding one in-process
--------------------------------------------------------
Running these models locally would mean adding torch or onnxruntime to the
backend: gigabytes of wheels, and a direct contradiction of the constraint
this codebase is built on -- "Only the standard library is used, so the
application gains no vendor dependency" (see llm/openai_compat.py).

Two runtimes are supported, behind one small protocol:

``ollama``
    A daemon that already speaks the OpenAI protocol and ships its own pull
    API with progress. Convenient, and opinionated: it decides what a model is
    called and where it lives.

``llamacpp``
    ``llama-server`` also speaks the OpenAI protocol, and is much lighter, but
    it has NO download API at all -- the documentation says to point it at a
    model you already have. So the app does that part itself: a plain HTTPS
    download of a GGUF file into a models directory, which also means progress
    is reported from a real Content-Length for the whole transfer.

The choice is configuration (``EMBEDDING_RUNTIME``), and it decides where a
download goes and which identifier the model gets on the wire. It does not
decide where embeddings are served: that stays ``EMBEDDING_BASE_URL``,
because either runtime may equally be left unconfigured and a hosted endpoint
used instead.

What this module does NOT do
----------------------------
It never changes configuration. Downloading makes a model available; switching
models invalidates the existing vector index, and the app must not do that
silently.

Progress and concurrency
------------------------
A download runs in a daemon thread and reports through an in-process status
object, mirroring the indexing pattern (services/indexing.py): not a job
framework, just enough state for the UI to poll. One download at a time per
(runtime, model): a repeat request for a running download returns the running
status rather than fetching the same gigabytes twice.
