//! Desktop shell for Apollo Delphi.
//!
//! The backend keeps its data (a SQLite database, uploads, werkmappen, downloaded models) in a per-user folder
//! of its own, see `backend/app/serve.py`: nothing here needs Docker or PostgreSQL.
//!
//! The application is a Python/FastAPI backend plus a React frontend. This
//! crate is only the window and the process supervisor: it starts the
//! repository's own virtualenv Python, waits for the API to answer, points the
//! webview at it, and shuts the child down when the window closes.
//!
//! Why the window loads a URL rather than bundling the frontend
//! ------------------------------------------------------------
//! `frontendDist` is still declared in tauri.conf.json so `tauri build`
//! produces a self-contained bundle, but the window is navigated to the local
//! server at runtime. Loading the page from the server itself means the
//! webview and the API share one origin, exactly as they do behind the Vite
//! dev proxy. That avoids three separate problems:
//!
//!   * no CORS configuration, and no wildcard-origin relaxation,
//!   * no `tauri://` asset protocol or CSP gymnastics for API calls, and
//!   * the session cookie (HttpOnly) is an ordinary same-origin cookie.
//!
//! Why the child process is started with std::process
//! ---------------------------------------------------
//! Tauri can spawn sidecars through `tauri-plugin-shell`, but that plugin
//! requires granting the frontend `shell:allow-execute` -- the ability to run
//! arbitrary commands from page script. This app does not need that: the
//! process is launched once, from Rust, with a fixed argument list. Spawning
//! it directly means the webview has no process-spawning permission at all,
//! which is a meaningfully smaller attack surface if the frontend is ever
//! compromised.
